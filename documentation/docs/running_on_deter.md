To deploy your experiment on Deterlab, please save it as NS file and as Bash script(s). Use the NS file to swap the experiment in. Once swapped in, run the Bash script(s) on the user's machine. If you run a script without parameters, it will display an error message letting you know which parameters need to be specified.

If you omit to specify something in your DEW format (e.g. Bindings), the scripts may be incomplete and will not run. You can manually edit the scripts to provide missing information.
