# Backup and recovery

One of the benefits of DEW is the ability to back up and recover a previous version seamlessly.


## Version history
DEW automatically stores a version for every save performed for the experiment and allows you to revert to an earlier version. To know more about how to revert to a version, [click here](../experiment_page#version-history)

## Google Drive

If the user is saving to Google Drive, previous versions  of the files can be viewed and you can revert to a particular version in Google Drive. However, to get the changes in Google Drive reflected in DEW, the user must [reupload the DEW file](../experiment_page#upload).
