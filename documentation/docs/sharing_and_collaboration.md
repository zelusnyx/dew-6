# Sharing and Collaboration

One of the benefits of DEW is the ability to share and collaborate with multiple people. It is possible to [share directly on the UI](./experiment_page.md#share-to-user), or to use Google Drive.

## Sharing in DEW

To share an experiment with another user, both users must have accounts in DEW. Along with sharing, the creator of the experiment can also control the access a user has for the experiment.

### Access levels
There are 3 levels

* **Spectator/Read only** - The user can only view the experiment and cannot change it.
* **Developer/Write** - The user can change the contents of the experiment but cannot change sharing settings
* **Admin/Manage** - The user will have the ability to change all aspects of an experiment. This is the level of access assigned to the creator of the experiment.


## Sharing in Google Drive

Another way to share a DEW experiment with others is to save the experiment to Google Drive. After saving to Google Drive, the user can share the files to anyone just like any other folder or file on Google Drive.
