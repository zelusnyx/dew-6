When contributing orchestration scripts 
create a new folder with contributor's name or handle.
If the whole experiment is contributed then deposit it in 
WholeExperiments folder, in the separate folder.
In both cases note the contributor's name and email in contributor.txt
file. If there are any orchestration scripts in the bundle
copy them to the appropriate script folder.
