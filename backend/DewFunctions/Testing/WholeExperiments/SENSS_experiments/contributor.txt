I have created one script which executes the entire installation process. It's easy to navigate through the script, as each function in the script 
performs one task. I will go through each one the task ranking them based on their difficulty. I have left out some functions which may have 
dependencies. Please reach out to me if you have any problems. 

Simple setup
- Setting up databases - setup.py#L27
- Adding entries to databases - setup.py#L36
- Installing dependencies - setup.py#L46
- Starting the SDN controller - setup.py#L55
- Starting OVS - setup.py#L67


Medium to hard setup
- Configuring BGP using quagga and zebra setup.py#L431

- Configuring OVS - setup.py#L87

- Installing DPDK - setup.py#L178


Each one of these tasks should be performed in a particular order. Please refer the function on this line for the ordering - setup.py#L235
