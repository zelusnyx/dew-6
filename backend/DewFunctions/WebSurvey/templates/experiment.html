You have a new Denial of Service (DoS) defense designed to protect
webservers. You would like to use the DETERLab testbed to evaluate your new
defense. Your defense is designed to run on a firewall machine that sits
between the protected webserver and the rest of the world. This firewall
machine must run Ubuntu 16.04. You would like to evaluate how well your
defense works against a varying number of attackers.
